As artificial intelligence reshapes jobs, industries and entire economies, the most powerful investment the world can make is not in machines, but in people — specifically, women. That was the central message emerging from discussions around human capital and economic resilience at the World Economic Forum (WEF), where leaders are calling for a gender-intentional approach to reskilling the global workforce.AdvertisementRelated ArticlesDavos 2026: Globalisation is now splintering into a multi-nodal trade system, says WEF According to the World Economic Forum, investing in women’s employment is the most efficient path toward building a resilient, inclusive and future-proof economy. Yet, despite years of progress, women remain significantly underrepresented in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) — the very fields that will define the next phase of economic growth. “Investing in women is investing in humanity’s most underutilized economic engine,” the WEF emphasised, warning that without gender parity in STEM and technology, the global economy risks locking in long-term inequality at precisely the moment when adaptability matters most. AI’s double-edged disruption The urgency is underscored by the scale of technological disruption already underway. The WEF’s Future of Jobs Report 2023 estimates that 22% of today’s jobs will be transformed by AI over the next five years. While 69 million new roles are expected to emerge, 83 million jobs could be displaced — resulting in a net loss of 14 million jobs globally. Advertisement This transformation, the Forum notes, presents a stark choice. If reskilling and upskilling programmes remain gender-blind, automation could deepen existing inequalities. If designed with intention, however, the same technological shift could unlock unprecedented economic participation for women. “Reskilling is non-negotiable,” the WEF said, adding that gender-neutral approaches risk automating inequality rather than opportunity. A gender-intentional strategy To avoid that outcome, the World Economic Forum is advocating a three-pronged, gender-focused investment strategy. The first priority is closing the foundational STEM gap. Initiatives such as Global Engineer Girls (GEG), which encourage young women to pursue core STEM disciplines, are seen as essential building blocks. “A high-tech future cannot be built on an unequal foundation,” the Forum noted, calling for expanded funding for early-stage, gender-specific STEM education. Advertisement Second is upskilling women already in the workforce — particularly in emerging economies — who are concentrated in roles most vulnerable to automation. The WEF stresses the need for rapid training in digital fluency, AI literacy and human-centric skills such as critical thinking, creativity and collaboration. Here, the private sector has a decisive role to play by offering flexible, accessible and certified learning programmes. The third focus area targets what the Forum describes as an “emerging economy tsunami.” Nearly 800 million young people will enter working age across emerging markets over the next decade. Training and mentoring young women for new-collar jobs — including data annotation, ethical AI auditing and green technology roles — could transform a looming labour surplus into a global competitive advantage. From electricians to climate engineers The Forum points to real-world labour shortages as evidence of the scale of opportunity. In the United States alone, the economy needs an estimated one million additional electricians as the green energy transition accelerates and large segments of the workforce retire. Similar gaps are emerging worldwide across clean energy, infrastructure and digital services. As Chair of the WEF’s Engineering and Construction Industry Group noted, the transition to net-zero infrastructure and circular economic models demands innovative thinking at an unprecedented scale.
