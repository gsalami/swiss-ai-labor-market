The collaboration combines Pearson’s science, digital content, and AI-powered learning tools with Deloitte’s experience in transformation, engineering, and workforce design. Together, the companies aim to address immediate market needs that include AI-enabled learning, leadership development, and scalable training solutions for complex organizations. Preparing a future-ready workforce has moved to the center of corporate and public-sector strategy, says Joe Ucuzoglu, CEO, Deloitte Global. He says the collaboration brings together Deloitte’s capabilities in engineering, workforce design, and skills transformation with Pearson’s learning and assessment solutions, enabling clients to adapt to changes in how work is structured and performed. The goal, he adds, is to help organizations build workforces that are sustainable and able to evolve alongside new technologies. The alliance is structured around the creation of new learning capabilities designed to help organizations respond to evolving talent requirements. These offerings will span a range of AI-enhanced solutions, from industry-specific and in-role skills intelligence platforms to large-scale learning delivery, assessments, and credentialing systems. According to the companies, the objective is to support employees, leaders, and pre-career talent as roles change, while helping organizations maintain productivity and competitiveness. The World Economic Forum (WEF) estimates that nearly 40% of job skills will change by 2030, driven largely by advances in AI, data analytics, and automation. In Mexico, this transition has intensified pressure on companies that report difficulty finding candidates with job-ready technical competencies, reports MBN. As part of the agreement, Deloitte will act as one of Pearson’s strategic technology collaborators, supporting the acceleration of AI adoption across Pearson’s portfolio. This includes contributing to product innovation and helping align learning solutions with the practical needs of employers operating across multiple sectors and regions. In parallel, Deloitte will also become a customer of Pearson, deploying the company’s AI-powered learning products and services internally to support its own workforce development efforts. Omar Abbosh, CEO, Pearson, says the alliance reflects the growing pressure on organizations to rethink how learning is delivered as skills become outdated more quickly. He says continuous and adaptive learning, embedded into everyday work, has become essential for organizations seeking to remain resilient. By combining Pearson’s expertise in learning science with Deloitte’s transformation capabilities, the partnership is intended to help employers build agility at scale, he adds. Pearson is a global lifelong learning company, serving customers in nearly 200 countries with digital learning content, assessments, qualifications, and data. The company employs about 18,000 people and focuses on using technology to support learning outcomes across education and professional settings. “​​This global collaboration unites our collective strengths to deliver cutting-edge, AI-powered learning and workforce solutions designed to empower organisations to thrive in the future of work,” writes Robert Cullen, Managing Partner, UK Technology & Transformation, Deloitte, on LinkedIn. Deloitte operates through a global network of member firms under Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Limited. Each firm is legally separate and independent, providing professional services while operating within a shared global framework.
