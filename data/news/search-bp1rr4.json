Out of this, around 25,000 “employees” are AI agents working alongside a human headcount of more than 40,000. And according to CEO Bob Sternfels, this is just the beginning. The company is now aiming to enable every human employee with at least one AI agent to assist with work and improve productivity.advertisementSpeaking recently at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas, Sternfels said the firm’s use of AI agents has surged from just a few thousand to nearly 25,000 in less than two years. And looking ahead, the company is aiming to equip every employee with at least one AI agent. In an episode of Harvard Business Review’s IdeaCast, Sternfels revealed that McKinsey has big plans when it comes to integrating artificial intelligence. He said that just a year and a half ago, the company used only a few thousand agents, but that number has now jumped significantly. The firm now hopes that in the next year and a half, every employee will be “enabled by at least one or more agents.” This figure was also confirmed by a company spokesperson to Business Insider.To give some context, AI agents are not simple chatbots. They are autonomous systems that can break down problems, design workflows, carry out tasks, and deliver outputs with minimal human prompting. At McKinsey, the company has deployed these agents to support research, data analysis, document preparation, and client deliverables, areas that were once heavily dependent on junior consultants. And the reason is said to be efficiency and productivity. Sternfels revealed that at McKinsey, this AI led transformation is part of what he calls the “25-squared” model. Under this model, the company is growing its client-facing roles by about 25 per cent, while cutting non-client-facing jobs by roughly the same amount. The AI agents have also helped the firm save 1.5 million hours over the past year by taking over routine search and synthesis tasks. For instance, Sternfels revealed that the agents produced 2.5 million charts in just six months, freeing consultants to focus on higher-value work such as strategy development, client engagement, and decision-making.Although AI agents are proving to work well alongside humans, Sternfels is clear that AI is not replacing people, at least not in the areas that matter most. He argues that humans retain a decisive edge in three domains: setting aspirations, exercising judgment, and genuine creativity.advertisementNevertheless the implications for jobs due to AI are hard to ignore. McKinsey & Company has already seen its non-client-facing workforce shrink by about a quarter, even as output from those functions has risen by roughly 10 per cent. At the same time, hiring criteria are also changing.However, with 25,000 AI agents now counted as part of its workforce, McKinsey is among the other big giants like Amazon who are actively pushing AI in the name of efficiency and productivity, while gradually replacing parts of human labour with machine intelligence.- EndsPublished By: Divya BhatiPublished On: Jan 14, 2026Also Read | Tech startup backed by Nvidia and SpaceX to build hotel on Moon by 2023, room price revealedAlso Read | After cutting 1,000 jobs, Meta plans massive 300 percent bonuses for select employeesAlso Read | OpenAI smart device could be a computer in shape of earphones, may challenge Apple AirPods Watch Live TV"
