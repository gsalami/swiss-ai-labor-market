This \"25 squared\" approach sees client-facing roles grow 25% while backend positions shrink, boosting output. AI saves millions of hours annually on routine tasks, allowing consultants to focus on complex challenges and unique human skills like judgment and creativity. McKinsey is experiencing a workforce transformation driven by AI, with its top boss revealing that the consulting giant now employs 25,000 AI agents alongside 40,000 human employees—and expects those numbers to match by year's end.Bob Sternfels, McKinsey's global managing partner, shared these insights during a Consumer Electronics Show appearance in Las Vegas, outlining what he calls the \"25 squared\" approach. Client-facing roles—the consultants who work directly with clients—are growing by 25%. Meanwhile, non-client-facing positions have shrunk by roughly the same percentage, even as output from those roles increased 10%.\"Our model has always been synonymous that growth only occurs with total head count growth. Now it's actually splitting,\" Sternfels explained. The firm can now expand its client-facing workforce while reducing backend roles, still achieving overall growth—something he described as a new paradigm for the company.AI agents save McKinsey 1.5 million hours annuallyThe productivity gains have been substantial. McKinsey saved 1.5 million hours last year alone on search and synthesis work—tasks typically handled by junior employees. The firm's AI agents have also generated 2.5 million charts in the past six months, freeing up consultants to tackle more complex problems.Sternfels said this shift means McKinsey consultants are \"moving up the stack\" rather than spending time on routine tasks that AI can handle efficiently.What young professionals should focus onFor those entering the workforce, Sternfels identified three skills AI can't replicate: the ability to set aspirations, human judgment, and genuine creativity. He emphasized that AI models work through inference—predicting the next likely step—but lack the capacity for truly orthogonal thinking that breaks existing patterns.The AI transformation also extends to hiring practices. Sternfels suggested companies should focus less on where candidates went to school and more on demonstrable skills, like reviewing a tech candidate's GitHub portfolio rather than their university credentials.End of ArticleFollow Us On Social MediaPhotostoriesHow to handle criticism without getting angry or offended: 5 effective tips10 must-have dishes in the city of JaipurHow to make South Indian Onion Uttapam for breakfast8 plants that bring calm, luck, and positive energy to your home10 phrases to avoid before sending your child to school (and why)3-ingredient thick hot chocolate recipe for cosy winter nightsNupur Sanon and Stebin Ben’s romantic pictures together ahead of the dreamy wedding7 winter ladoos packed with protein that actually keep you fullStebin Ben’s most romantic songs that will make you fall in love with the singerTop motivational series to watch on OTT123Hot PicksTrump tariffsUS Supreme CourtGold rate todayBengaluru newsCigarette price hikePublic holidays January 2026Bank Holidays JanuaryTop TrendingUS Border Petrol Agent ShootCanada Immigration Applications 2026Iran ProtestsVanessa BryantTrump TariffsConnor McDavidNFL PlayoffsJustin HerbertWPL Live ScoreStefon DiggsTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn SectionEntire WebsiteGoogle chief scientist Jeff Dean calls ICE arrest of teens in Minnesota as 'completely not okay', Elon Musk responds, says: Do you have ...Bill Gates pens the year 2026 note; says: Thing I am most upset about is ...Microsoft AI boss warns rivals: You can't align what you can't control; it's dangerousChina to Mark Zuckerberg's Meta: We need to be sure that you have not broken any Chinese law on ...Security Vulnerability Incident: Respawn fixes Apex Legends hack; permanent solution in worksIndonesia Grok Ban: Nation blocks Musk’s chatbot over d"
