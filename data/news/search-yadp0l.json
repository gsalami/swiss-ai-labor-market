Empathy in education policy, practice and assessment 5 February 14:00 CET Empathy plays a central role in how children interact with others, build relationships and contribute to supportive and inclusive schools. It matters for cohesive, peaceful societies. Yet while many recognise its importance, education systems still struggle to define empathy, teach it and create policies and assessments to support and monitor its development. In this webinar, we will explore why empathy matters for education systems and how it can be measured, understood and implemented. Bringing together global perspectives from research, policy and practice, the discussion will examine how we can support system-level strategies and school-based initiatives that foster empathy, children’s wellbeing, and positive school climates. This webinar draws on the innovative work on empathy by the OECD’s Survey on Social and Emotional Skills (SSES). In 2026, the SSES will assess empathy in a dedicated assessment for the first time, creating comparable data from nearly 20 countries. Join us to see how we can bring empathy to the heart of education.

For those targeted, it can lead to fear, isolation, declining mental health, loss of confidence and disrupted learning. A new OECD paper, Bullying in education: prevalence, impact and responses across countries, reveals which groups are most vulnerable to bullying and highlights where the problem is most widespread across countries. In this Q&A webinar, experts will discuss the paper’s findings and look at what works in education settings, including how to respond when cyberbullying blurs the boundaries between school and home and how we can support those most at risk of experiencing repeated or severe bullying.

The OECD’s new report, Digital Education Outlook 2026, examines the latest global research on this question. The report examines whether GenAI can enhance learning when used within clear pedagogical frameworks and the dangers of relying on these new tools without teacher guidance or input. At this virtual launch, OECD experts looked at the latest findings on the impact of GenAI in education, explored the benefits and risks of AI tutors and assistantsand shared design principles to make these tools effective in classrooms.
