The findings pour more cold water on the hyperbole surrounding AI and the benefits it supposedly brings to business, although the report cautions that \"clearly, we're in the early stages of the AI era.\" Only 12 percent reported both lower costs and higher revenue, while 56 percent saw neither benefit. Twenty-six percent saw reduced costs, but nearly as many experienced cost increases. <a href=\"https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?co=1&amp;iu=/6978/reg_software/aiml&amp;sz=300x50%7C300x100%7C300x250%7C300x251%7C300x252%7C300x600%7C300x601&amp;tile=2&amp;c=2aX0UDM83fUqKMiMkGKNHmAAAA8E&amp;t=ct%3Dns%26unitnum%3D2%26raptor%3Dcondor%26pos%3Dtop%26test%3D0\" target=\"_blank\"> <img src=\"https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?co=1&amp;iu=/6978/reg_software/aiml&amp;sz=300x50%7C300x100%7C300x250%7C300x251%7C300x252%7C300x600%7C300x601&amp;tile=2&amp;c=2aX0UDM83fUqKMiMkGKNHmAAAA8E&amp;t=ct%3Dns%26unitnum%3D2%26raptor%3Dcondor%26pos%3Dtop%26test%3D0\" alt=\"\"> </a> AI adoption remains limited.

Despite the CEOs' repsonses, PwC concludes more investment is required. It claims that \"isolated, tactical AI projects\" often don't deliver measurable value, and that tangible returns instead come from enterprise-wide deployments consistent with business strategy. <a href=\"https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?co=1&amp;iu=/6978/reg_software/aiml&amp;sz=300x50%7C300x100%7C300x250%7C300x251%7C300x252%7C300x600%7C300x601&amp;tile=4&amp;c=44aX0UDM83fUqKMiMkGKNHmAAAA8E&amp;t=ct%3Dns%26unitnum%3D4%26raptor%3Dfalcon%26pos%3Dmid%26test%3D0\" target=\"_blank\"> <img src=\"https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?co=1&amp;iu=/6978/reg_software/aiml&amp;sz=300x50%7C300x100%7C300x250%7C300x251%7C300x252%7C300x600%7C300x601&amp;tile=4&amp;c=44aX0UDM83fUqKMiMkGKNHmAAAA8E&amp;t=ct%3Dns%26unitnum%3D426raptor%3Dfalcon%26pos%3Dmid%26test%3D0\" alt=\"\"> </a> However, pilot projects are by their very nature typically small scale and isolated in order to demonstrate the viability of a concept before risking an enterprise-wide rollout. Is PwC advising clients not to worry if an AI pilot project fails, and push ahead with a large-scale deployment anyway? The report then goes on to explain that scaling up demands \"strong AI foundations,\" including a technology environment that enables AI integration; a clearly defined roadmap for AI initiatives; formalized risk processes; and \"an organizational culture that enables AI adoption.\" So if your AI projects fail, you clearly just don't believe enough.
